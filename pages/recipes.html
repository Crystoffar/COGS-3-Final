        <h2>Easy Recipes</h2>
          <p>
            I want to present dishes that are hopefully easy to make for
            beginners that have ingredients that many likely have during
            these times. If there are ingredients that need to be used,
            try and toss them in. In my experience, cooking is fun to experiment
            with because only you know what tastes best.
          </p>
        <h3>Pasta Aglio e Olio</h3>
          <p>
            The dish, pasta aglio e olio, translates quite literally to 
            garlic and oil pasta. It's much tastier than it first sounds!

          <ul>
              <li>1/2 head garlic</li>
              <li>1/2 cup parsley</li>
              <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
              <li>pasta (linguine)</li>
              <li>1/2 lemon</li>
              <li>salt and pepper</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li>Heavily salt a large pot of water until it resembles the 
                ocean, and bring the pot to a boil. Cook the pasta, but allow
                the pasta to be slightly underdone. It will finish cooking later 
                in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>While the pasta cooks, slice the garlic cloves thinly. Heat the 
              olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. The olive oil will start 
              shimmering when ready.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the sliced garlic to the pan, and stir constantly so the garlic 
              doesn't burn. Once the garlic has softened and turned golden on the 
              edges, lower the heat to medium low and add the red pepper flakes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the pasta to the pan with about 1/4 cup of the pasta water. The
              pasta water will help with the sauce. Squeeze lemon juice over top, 
              and mix in the parsley. If the sauce is too watery, continue to cook
              in the pan until the pasta has absorbed more of the liquid. To finish, 
              season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <h3>Honey Soy Glazed Salmon </h3>
          <p>
            This <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/honey-soy-glazed-salmon">recipe</a> 
            from Tasty gets a pass from the both of us. There is a nice balance of sweetness
            from the honey; savory umami from the soy sauce; heat from the red pepper; and 
            fattiness from the salmon. A side of rice and vegetables ties everything together
            nicely!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>12 oz skinless salmon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper</li>
            <li>1/3 cup less sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Place salmon in a sealable ziploc bag or medium bowl, and mince
              the garlic cloves and ginger.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix the garlic, ginger, red pepper, 
              half of the olive oil, soy sauce, and honey to create a marinade. Pour 
              half of the marinade on the salmon. Save the other half for later.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let the salmon marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, 
              but not over an hour.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a pan, heat the other tablespoon of oil on medium-high heat. 
              Add salmon to the pan. Cook salmon on oneside for about 2-3 minutes, 
              then flip over and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
              </li>
            <li>
              Remove salmon from pan. Pour in remaining marinade and reduce. Serve 
              the salmon with the reduced sauce and any additional sides.
            </li>
          </ol>
