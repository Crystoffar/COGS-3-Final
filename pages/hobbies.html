        <h2>Hobbies you could pick up in Quarantine</h2>
          <p>
            Quarantine has made it difficult to enjoy many things that we might enjoy, but it's also an opportunity to maybe pick up some hobbies. We wanted to talak about 
            some hobbies that we've picked up while in quarantine.
          </p>
        <h3>Art</h3>
          <p>
            Art is a great creative outlet even without any experience. Although I have been 
            drawing for years, I never took it very seriously until winter quarter when I took 
            a rec class in UCSD's Main Gym. My peers were all at differing skill levels, and the 
            instrutor assured us that everyone could learn something from just the basics. It was 
            true. I gained confidence in practicing art, and drawing both physically and digitally 
            throughout the quarantine has proved to be relaxing (especially when everything else is  
            so stressful). Click on the image below to see my notes on shading and figure drawing.

        <h3>Origami</h3>
          <p>
            Origami is the Japanese art of folding paper. Origami is a hobby that I had previously done, but I decided to pick it up again during quarantine. My days have become 
            full of staring at screens whether it be for classes or for entertainment. There's something therapeutic for me to just focus on folding paper. Origami is especially
            easy to get into, as it just requires a piece of paper and a tutorial to follow. I personally enjoy following tutorials from 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jonakashima/videos">Jo Nakashima</a> on YouTube. If you're just starting out, make sure to find a tutorial for a relatively easy
            project before trying more complex projects. At first, it can be hard to understand the folds that tutorials are making, but 
            just take your time and keep trying and you'll get it down eventually. I find it extremely difficult to do anything perfectly the first time, but if you keep 
            practicing you can make really cool creations just out of paper. If you decide that you're really enjoying origami, you can purchase hundreds of beautiful sheets of origami
            paper on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=origami+paper&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon</a> for a pretty low cost.
