        <h3>Christopher Vu</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Chris and I'm a Computer Engineering Major in Revelle College. I'm currently taking this class because I'm potentially thinking of doing a COGS minor 
          and I also wanted to learn basics on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of my interests include playing video game and watching anime. Some games I'm currently playing
          are Animal Crossing: New Horizons, League of Legends, and Valorant. Some anime that I've been watching recently are Tower of God, Sing Yesterday for Me, and Dororo. 
          Most of my days in quarantine have been filled with playing games and watching YouTube videos in between attending Zoom lectures and doing the mountain of homework 
          provided to me by my CS classes and HUM. I also have a dog named Butters, He's a Chiweenie (Chihuahua-Dachsund mix) and he's turning 6 soon! 
        </p>
        <h3>Amy Le</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a first-year Biochemistry/Chemistry major from Revelle College. Although I'm a chemistry major, I want to explore different subjects. 
          I've done JavaScript in my spare time before, but never HTML, CSS, or Bootstrap. In my spare time, I play games, watch videos, and draw.
          My interest in video games and art compelled me to start designing my own game prototype. There's not much to it yet since I am animating
          and creating all of the assets, but I hope to finish the base over the summer.
